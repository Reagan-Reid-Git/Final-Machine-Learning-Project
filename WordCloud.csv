Obesity is a growing public health crisis, particularly among young adults. This study projected obesity related mortality rates in the United States, providing an outlook on future trends.

Methods
Data were obtained from the CDC Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER) multiple causes of death database, focusing on the underlying cause of death as obesity (ICD-10 codes E66.0-E66.9) for young adults aged 18–39. Temporal trends in crude mortality rate (CMR) were assessed using Joinpoint software. Future mortality rates were forecasted using an optimal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model.

Results
Between 1999 and 2023, there were 19,451 deaths with obesity as the underlying cause of death (males 60.58%) in young adults aged 18–39. Overall, the CMR showed an annual percent change (APC) of 3.13% (95% CI 2.45%–3.85%) for 1999–2023. The forecasted APC for 2024–2035 was 1.30% (95% CI 0.35%–2.31%). For females, CMR increased from 0.4/100,000 in 1999 to 0.8/100,000 in 2023, showing an APC of 2.44% (95% CI 1.71%–3.18%) with a forecasted APC of 2.81% (95% CI 2.74%–2.87%). For males, CMR increased from 0.6/100,000 in 1999 to 1.4/100,000 in 2023, showing an APC of 3.59% (95% CI 2.78%–4.42%) with a forecasted APC of 3.16% (95% CI 3.12%–3.20%).

Conclusion
This study demonstrated the efficacy of machine learning in projecting public health trends, providing critical insights into the future burden of obesity-related mortality among young adults in the United States.","In our study, the analysis of data from 1999 to 2023 revealed a concerning upward trend in obesity-related mortality among young adults aged 18–39. The overall crude mortality rate increased from 0.5 per 100,000 in 1999 to 1.1 per 100,000 in 2023, reflecting an annual percent change (APC) of 3.13%. The ARIMA model employed to project future mortality rates until 2035, predicted a continued rise in obesity-related mortality, with an expected rate of 1.3 per 100,000 in 2024 and a projected increase to 1.51 per 100,000 by 2035, reflecting an APC of 1.30%. Gender-specific predictions indicate that by 2035, males are projected to have a CMR of 1.80 per 100,000, with an APC of 3.16%, while females are projected to reach a CMR of 1.13 per 100,000 with an AAPC of 2.81%. These predictions emphasized the necessity for targeted interventions to address the distinct needs and risk factors of different gender groups.

Obesity is associated with reduced life expectancy. In 2014, Kitara et al. in their study that extreme obesity could reduce lifespan by up to 14 years; specifically, individuals with a BMI of 40–44.9 lost an average of 6.5 years, while those with a BMI of 55–59.9 lost about 13.7 years [19]. Ward et al. reported that excess weight in the United States leads to an average life expectancy loss of nearly 2.4 years, where individuals with a BMI of 40–59 kg/m2 lose an estimated 6.5–13.7 years of life compared to those with a BMI of 18.5–24.9 kg/m2 [10]. The life expectancy loss continued to increase beyond a BMI of 50 kg/m2, with a 9.8-year reduction, surpassing the 8.9-year reduction observed for current versus never smokers [10].

Obeki et al. (2018–2021) found that among different age groups, individuals aged 25–34 exhibited a higher rate of obesity-related mortality among males (62.74%) compared to females (37.26%). Additionally, within the 25 to 34 age group, there were 1943 reported deaths due to obesity-related complications, of which females accounted for 37.26%, whereas males accounted for 62.74% [20]. Notably in our study, gender-specific analyses also indicated that males have experienced a higher increase in mortality rates compared to females with an increase in the CMR rose from 0.6 per 100,000 in 1999 to 1.4 per 100,000 in 2023, with an APC of 3.59% in males. In contrast, females showed an increase from 0.4 to 0.8 per 100,000 during the same period, with an AAPC of 2.44%. These disparities highlight the need for gender-specific public health interventions and preventive strategies.

The interplay between obesity, gender, and mortality is intricate and can be affected by multiple factors, resulting in differences across various populations and time periods. Excess weight significantly increases the risk of nearly every major cause of death, suggesting a broad range of physiological impacts. Most of the excess mortality has been linked to heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and kidney and liver diseases [21, 22]. Obesity is closely associated with metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia [23]. The severity of these metabolic abnormalities increases with higher BMI and tends to improve with weight loss through lifestyle changes or bariatric surgery [24]. Additionally, extreme obesity may cause other physiological impairments, such as reduced lung capacity and airway obstruction, leading to higher mortality from chronic lower respiratory disease [25-27].

Flegal et al. (2013) demonstrated that obesity is associated with increased all-cause mortality, particularly among younger adults. Their findings corroborate the rising trend in obesity-related mortality rates observed in our study [28]. Another study by Masters et al. (2013) reported similar trends between 1986 and 2006, where overweight and obesity were associated with 5.0% and 15.6% of adult deaths among Black and White men, and 26.8% and 21.7% among Black and White women, respectively [29].

Our study utilized robust statistical methodologies, including Joinpoint Trend Analysis Software and ARIMA modeling, to analyze and forecast mortality trends. The Joinpoint software effectively identified significant temporal changes in mortality rates, while the ARIMA model provided accurate forecasts, validated through rigorous time series cross-validation and residual diagnostics [30]. The use of these advanced tools ensures the reliability and validity of the findings.

The increasing trend in obesity-related mortality among young adults calls for urgent action to implement effective obesity prevention and intervention programs. Public health strategies should focus on promoting healthy lifestyles, increasing awareness of obesity-related health risks, and providing access to resources for weight management. Moreover, the gender-specific differences in mortality trends and projections highlight the need for tailored interventions that address the unique risk factors and health behaviors of males and females.

However, there were several limitations to our study. The use of ICD codes for obesity may have underestimated the true number of obesity-related deaths. These codes specifically attributed obesity as the primary cause of death, potentially overlooking cases where obesity significantly contributed to mortality without being listed as the primary cause. Also, this study did not account for other significant factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity, which may have interacted with obesity and affected mortality rates. While the ARIMA model was robust for forecasting non-stationary time series data, it relied on historical data trends and assumed that past patterns would continue. This may not have accounted for unexpected public health interventions or changes in obesity prevalence (AAPC/APC). The high RMSE relative to small CMR values may indicate prediction uncertainty. The study did not consider the potential variability in BMI thresholds and their association with mortality among different racial/ethnic groups. Also, there was a lack of consensus in the literature on the appropriateness of standard BMI categories for various subpopulations, which complicated the understanding of how obesity impacted different groups and might have affected the study's estimates. Despite these limitations, the study provided valuable insights into the future burden of obesity among young adults in the United States. Future research should aim to address these limitations by incorporating more detailed and diverse datasets and refining the modeling approaches to better capture the complexity of obesity-related mortality."

Hospitalized patients with severe obesity require adapted hospital management. The aim of this study was to evaluate a machine learning model to predict in‐hospital mortality among this population.

Methods
Data of unselected consecutive emergency department admissions of hospitalized patients with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2) was analyzed. Data was retrieved from five hospitals from the Mount Sinai health system, New York. The study time frame was between January 2011 and December 2019. Data was used to train a gradient‐boosting machine learning model to identify in‐hospital mortality. The model was trained and evaluated based on the data from four hospitals and externally validated on held‐out data from the fifth hospital.

Results
A total of 14,078 hospital admissions of inpatients with severe obesity were included. The in‐hospital mortality rate was 297/14,078 (2.1%). In univariate analysis, albumin (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.77), blood urea nitrogen (AUC = 0.76), acuity level (AUC = 0.73), lactate (AUC = 0.72), and chief complaint (AUC = 0.72) were the best single predictors. For Youden’s index, the model had a sensitivity of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.67–0.86) with a false positive rate of 1:9.

Conclusion
A machine learning model trained on clinical measures provides proof of concept performance in predicting mortality in patients with severe obesity. This implies that such models may help to adopt specific decision support tools for this population.","This research presents a machine learning tool that can predict in‐hospital mortality in patients with severe obesity at the time of admission. Mortality prediction among hospitalized patients with severe obesity is challenging. Predictive models for patients with severe obesity at risk may be beneficial.

The study utilized a large cohort of patients with severe obesity that were hospitalized. An extensive number of data points was collected from the time of ED admission. These included demographics, comorbidities, laboratory results, and ED assessment. Albumin was a strong predictor of mortality. Hypoalbuminemia represents illness severity and was shown to be associated with mortality. 34 Abnormal albumin levels may also be an indicator of nutrition status. In patients with obesity, a high caloric intake does not necessarily correlate with proper nutrition. They may even suffer from malnutrition. 35 Although this test was the best single mortality predictor, it was limited to an AUC of 0.77.

Big data has the potential to help us understand obesity and to address the challenges of this 21st‐century epidemic. 36 In recent years, there is an increased usage of machine learning in obesity research. 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 Studies that have applied machine learning to obesity have helped predict the disease itself as well as understand the underlying biological and psychological mechanisms of this disease. In this study, machine learning was utilized to predict in‐hospital mortality in patients with severe obesity. Since the mortality rate is low (∼2%), this may be considered a needle in a haystack problem. For Youden’s index, the model achieved a sensitivity of 77% with a false positive rate of 1:9. While not perfect, this proof of concept suggests that a targeted system for patients with severe obesity may alert physicians to about 80% of high‐risk patients, while creating one out of nine false positives (high specificity of about 90%). It should be noted that there are scores that predict mortality among the patients with obesity. Examples include Kings Obesity Staging Criteria and Edmonton Obesity Staging System. 41 However, these tools are not used for acute hospitalized patients.

The complexity of predicting mortality among hospitalized patients with severe obesity was evident in this study. Intuitively, it could be assumed that patients with severe obesity who did not survive would have more comorbidities. Yet, this was not evident in this study. Additionally, most single variables did not have a distinguishing capability. Thus, it is clear that the physician’s ability to predict mortality of patients with severe obesity is limited. The medical staff must be aware of this population's unique characteristics rather than rely on familiar patterns. Therefore, a decision support system that can alert to high‐risk patients with severe obesity can potentially enhance the care delivered to this population.

This study has several limitations. This is a retrospective study. Missing data was recorded in some patients. Nevertheless, the GB model can integrate missing values. Additionally, although this was a multi‐center study, it was limited to an urban New York setting. Moreover, in this study, BMI was used to define severe obesity. Alternative indices can be used, such as the waist circumference and the waist‐to‐hip ratio. Also, different cutoff values of BMI could be used.

In conclusion, machine learning can predict in‐hospital mortality among patients with severe obesity. The utilization of a decision support system may assist with the management of this complex population."
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9887184/,Age-specific risk factors for the prediction of obesity using a machine learning approach,"Machine Learning is a powerful tool to discover hidden information and relationships in various data-driven research fields. Obesity is an extremely complex topic, involving biological, physiological, psychological, and environmental factors. One successful approach to the topic is machine learning frameworks, which can reveal complex and essential risk factors of obesity. Over the last two decades, the obese population (BMI of above 23) in Korea has grown. The purpose of this study is to identify risk factors that predict obesity using machine learning classifiers and identify the algorithm with the best accuracy among classifiers used for obesity prediction. This work will allow people to assess obesity risk from blood tests and blood pressure data based on the KNHANES, which used data constructed by the annual survey. Our data include a total of 21,100 participants (male 10,000 and female 11,100). We assess obesity prediction by utilizing six machine learning algorithms. We explore age- and gender-specific risk factors of obesity for adults (19–79 years old). Our results highlight the four most significant features in all age-gender groups for predicting obesity: triglycerides, ALT (SGPT), glycated hemoglobin, and uric acid. Our findings show that the risk factors for obesity are sensitive to age and gender under different machine learning algorithms. Performance is highest for the 19–39 age group of both genders, with over 70% accuracy and AUC, while the 60–79 age group shows around 65% accuracy and AUC. For the 40–59 age groups, the proposed algorithm achieved over 70% in AUC, but for the female participants, it achieved lower than 70% accuracy. For all classifiers and age groups, there is no big difference in the accuracy ratio when the number of features is more than six; however, the accuracy ratio decreased in the female 19–39 age group.","This study identifies risk factors for obesity in adults among the extensive dataset provided by the KDCA from 2016 to 2019 in Korea. First, in all six datasets, each of the top eight features was selected, which are shown in Figure 4. The eight features obtained by the mean of random forest value and mean absolute Shapley values include ALT (SGPT), glucose, triglyceride, white blood cell, glycated hemoglobin, creatinine, systolic (diastolic) blood pressure, AST (SGOT), cholesterol, hematocrit, platelet, and uric acid. For the three male datasets, the ALT (SGPT) was the most important feature in the mean of sharp value and random forest. For female datasets, triglyceride was the most important feature, except for the 60–79 age group. In the 60–79 age female group, HbA1c was the most important feature. The feature creatinine was only a top factor for the male 40–59 and 60–79 age groups.

Further research needs to be carried out using these factors with individual variances. Well-known factors for predicting obesity are age, gender, waist circumference, and race. These factors state the consequences of obesity. Moreover, various factors that cause obesity have been studied, and there have been many predictive studies using factors that affect obesity (1, 50, 55). Although a few researchers have included metabolic factors as key features in predicting obesity, most researchers have used individual factors, and individual lifestyle/behavioral and environmental factors as essential features (1, 5, 21). We identified essential metabolic factors affecting obesity and performed machine learning utilizing metabolic factors as key features. Our performance could not be compared with other research results, because the selected features are different (1, 56, 57).

In fact, there are other important factors that might influence obesity, such as food consumption, food production, physical activity, social psychology, genetic, or physiological and cultural influences, that were not included in our analysis because they are not suited for a machine learning approach. In addition, we used the KNHANES as data, but medical diagnostic records were not used.

Therefore, one of the main limitations of the study is that our features are not yet standard features for predicting obesity. It is important to evaluate and build predictive models for obesity using common risk factors. It would be desirable to improve the standardized of common factors affecting obesity because the current works have all dealt with different features. Another limitation of our model is the imbalanced data set from the KDCA, which contains a larger high-BMI population (people with BMI >23) than low-BMI population (people with BMI <23). A limitation of our study is that it did not use features such as gut microbiota composition, physiological, psychological, genetic, and environmental factors that cause obesity. Among the risk factors for obesity, we only used factors involved in metabolism as risk factors. We need to establish a set of risk factors for obesity in adults among the available study variables from those domains. Future research needs to identify and integrate risk factors in these areas. To facilitate future research, one needs to identify and integrate risk factors in these areas, and common features to predict obesity are required since there are many various factors that cause obesity. Hence, if standard factor assumptions are possible, common features to predict obesity may be used to carry out more elaborate predictions and sophisticated mathematical analysis.

Therefore, to confirm that and elucidate the underlying mechanism, we investigated mortality in older people using explainable artificial intelligence (AI) with the gradient-boosting algorithm XGboost. Baseline body mass indexes (BMIs) of 5699 people (79.3 ± 3.9 years) were evaluated to determine the relationship with all-cause mortality over eight years. In the unadjusted model, the first negative (protective) BMI range for mortality was 25.9–28.4 kg/m2. However, in the adjusted cross-validation model, this range was 22.7–23.6 kg/m2; the second and third negative BMI ranges were then 25.8–28.2 and 24.6–25.8 kg/m2, respectively. Conversely, the first advancing BMI range was 12.8–18.7 kg/m2, which did not vary across conditions with high feature importance. Actual and predicted mortality rates in participants aged <90 years showed a negative-linear or L-shaped relationship with BMI, whereas predicted mortality rates in men aged ≥90 years showed a blunt U-shaped relationship. In conclusion, AI predicted that being overweight may not be an optimal condition with regard to all-cause mortality in older adults. Instead, it may be that a high normal weight is optimal, though this may vary according to the age and sex.","This is the first study to address the relationship between the baseline BMI and mortality in the near future in older people using explainable AI. Explainable AI provides helpful information including the feature importance, reflecting the relative contribution degree to the outcome [15]. Although the age and sex (unmodifiable factors) were the strongest predictors of mortality (Table 2), our results demonstrated that BMI was the third contributor to mortality. The first positive (advancing) range of BMI for mortality, of 12.8–18.7 kg/m2, which usually reflects malnutrition, did not vary across the conditions, with a high feature importance regardless of cross-validation and covariate adjustment. Although the second positive range of BMI in the three models was 23.6–24.6 kg/m2, a high normal weight, the feature importance (0.020–0.026) in these ranges was small, at one-third to one-quarter of the first positive range of BMI of 12.8–18.7 kg/m2 (0.080–0.091; Table 1 and Table 2). This indicates that a low body weight is a persistent strong risk factor for increased mortality, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies [2,3,18].

The crude, no-cross-validation model revealed that the protective range of BMI for mortality was 25.9–28.4 kg/m2, implying that being overweight (obese for Japanese people) is an optimal condition that minimizes the all-cause mortality among older people. Figure 1 partially presents this simple unadjusted result, which is consistent with the results of recent studies using conventional statistical analyses [1,2,3,4,5,6]. However, in the cross-validation model, the orders of feature importance were different, indicating that a normal weight represents the first and being overweight (25.8–28.2 kg/m2) represents the third protective range for mortality. Regardless of cross-validation, the adjusted models revealed that the first protective range of BMI was 22.7–23.6 kg/m2, implying that a high normal weight may be the optimal condition to minimize all-cause mortality, while being overweight (or obese in Japan) is the second-leading condition to minimize mortality when covariates (confounding factors) are adjusted.

Given that the feature importance of the negative range of 22.7–23.6 kg/m2 BMI (0.032–0.049) was smaller than (almost half) that of the positive range of 12.8–18.7 kg/m2 BMI (0.080–0.091), and since the second positive range of BMI was 23.6–24.6 kg/m2 (a high normal weight), the overall relationship of a high normal weight or being overweight with mortality, if any, may not be strong, and it may be more complicated than the robust relationship between a low BMI and mortality in older people. This result may be consistent with the previous results of a study conducted on Japanese people [18].

Although common comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease were considered confounding factors in the models (Table 2), the cause of mortality and other concomitant comorbidities, such as cancers and infections, data for which were not available in this study, may influence the relationship between a normal-to-high BMI and mortality. Furthermore, considering that Japanese people have had the world’s greatest life expectancies in recent decades [19], the relationship between mortality rates and body weight might vary across different age groups and between men and women, even in their last stage of life.

According to Schooling et al. [20], obesity is associated with better outcomes in older people with a poor health status, which has been called the obesity paradox, now documented for several decades, but it is associated with a worse condition in those with an initially good health status. In this study, most of the subjects were apparently healthy people who had not been admitted to a hospital or nursing home at the beginning of the study period. That factor may have affected the observed outcomes

In this study, the relationship between the baseline BMI and mortality appeared to be negative-linear or L-shaped in participants in their 80s, which corresponds to the average Japanese life span, although no such relationship was observed in other age groups. Therefore, being overweight or obese might be advantageous for older people, positively impacting their longevity, mostly for older people with a poor health status. However, gaining weight to lower the risk of mortality in the near future might be unnecessary in older people if they have a high normal weight; this applies at ages both above and below the average life expectancy of the population.

In bringing this article to a close, methodological limitations such as the retrospective design, possible selection bias, and use of BMI as the obesity index [4] should be noted. As the BMI does not distinguish muscle from fat, additional measurements of the body composition and fat distribution [5], as well as fitness [6], may be useful for determining the health status of older people. In addition, the follow-up period of 7.22 years may be short to evaluate the relationship between BMI and mortality. As such, a long-term study including various obesity indices is needed to better evaluate the relationship between obesity and mortality in the elderly. Alternatively, further studies with different modes of extreme gradient boosting, such as decision tree and random forest, and populations with varying life expectancies, are warranted to confirm the results of the present study and underlying mechanisms."
https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/8/3966,Does Physical Activity Predict Obesity—A Machine Learning and Statistical Method-Based Analysis,"Background: Obesity prevalence has become one of the most prominent issues in global public health. Physical activity has been recognized as a key player in the obesity epidemic. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to (1) examine the relationship between physical activity and weight status and (2) assess the performance and predictive power of a set of popular machine learning and traditional statistical methods. Methods: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2003 to 2006) data were used. A total of 7162 participants met our inclusion criteria (3682 males and 3480 females), with average age ranging from 48.6 (normal weight) to 52.1 years old (overweight). Eleven classifying algorithms—including logistic regression, naïve Bayes, Radial Basis Function (RBF), local k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), classification via regression (CVR), random subspace, decision table, multiobjective evolutionary fuzzy classifier, random tree, J48, and multilayer perceptron—were implemented and evaluated, and they were compared with traditional logistic regression model estimates. Results: With physical activity and basic demographic status, of all methods analyzed, the random subspace classifier algorithm achieved the highest overall accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The duration of vigorous-intensity activity in one week and the duration of moderate-intensity activity in one week were important attributes. In general, most algorithms showed similar performance. Logistic regression was middle-ranking in terms of overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC among all methods. Conclusions: Physical activity was an important factor in predicting weight status, with gender, age, and race/ethnicity being less but still essential factors associated with weight outcomes. Tailored intervention policies and programs should target the differences rooted in these demographic factors to curb the increase in the prevalence of obesity and reduce disparities among sub-demographic populations.","This study is the first study in the field to assess adulthood overweight/obese risks using objectively measured PA data and advanced ML techniques. Our results indicate that PA (especially moderate to vigorous intensity) was a key risk factor in predicting overweight and obesity. In addition, duration of moderate-intensity activity and duration of vigorous-intensity activity ranked higher than the sum of the intensity value recorded by the physical activity monitor, duration of sedentary-intensity activity, duration of lifestyle-intensity activity, and duration of light-intensity activity. The results imply that high-intensity physical activity is more important than low-intensity physical activity and overall physical activity intensity. This finding aligns with our hypothesis and empirical evidence. Physical activity increases a person’s energy expenditure and helps individuals maintain their energy balance or even lose weight as long as energy consumption is not compensated by calorie intake [44]. Demographic features played a less but still critical role in predicting weight status as our ML and traditional statistical analyses suggested. This finding is in line with previous studies [15,45]. Underlying disparities associated with race/ethnicity including food environment, healthcare access, social environment, and building environment are important factors that predict the risk of obesity through complex known and unknown pathways [46]. This may provide guidance for obesity control.
We compared the performance of different ML algorithms in predicting weight status and found that the random subspace algorithm had a weak superiority over the other ten models. However, the logistic regression model performed slightly worse than the random subspace and several other algorithms. The random subspace classifier produced the highest overall accuracy and AUC among the eleven classifiers. It also produced the highest specificity for prediction of normal weight and the highest sensitivity for prediction of obesity. The sensitivity of the J48 classifier in normal weight prediction was 2.3% higher than the sensitivity of the random subspace classifier. The specificities of the J48 classifier in both normal weight and obesity predictions were also higher than the random subspace classifier. The overall accuracies of the J48 classifier were lower than those of the random subspace classifier. Furthermore, its sensitivity was 11.0% lower than the sensitivity of the random subspace classifier in prediction of obesity. Overall, the random subspace classifier outperformed the J48 classifier. Regarding obesity prediction, the specificity produced by the naïve Bayes classifier was 8.7% higher than that of the random subspace classifier. However, it performed worse than the other algorithms regarding overall accuracy and sensitivity.
Our results are comparable to existing studies. For instance, Jie et al. [47] reviewed 927 studies and provided no evidence of the superior performance of advanced machine learning methods over the logistic regression method for clinical predictions. Similarly, Tozlu et al. [48] used logistic regression and four other machine learning methods (adaptive boosting, ANN, RF, and SVM) to identify high infarction risk. They concluded that logistic regression performed as well as the other four machine learning approaches. In addition, Tozlu et al. [48] compared the performances of several machine learning models to predict the effect of labor induction on the occurrence of cesarean section and found that the logistic regression model produced a similar performance to the RF one. Therefore, advanced machine learning methods with high computational complexity are not always necessary in obesity prediction. Due to the well-understood theoretical and computational background, the logistic regression model is preferable when predicting obesity.
Some limitations of this study should be noted: First, ActiGraph AM-7164 is not waterproof, and thus some activities such as swimming were not captured. Thus, the collected data for some individuals who performed aquatic activities are not trustable. The device may not have been able to accurately detect upper-body exercises, such as lifting dumbbells. Second, this study only examined weight status but not body composition, which is planned for our future research."
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11529325/,Using interpretable machine learning methods to identify the relative importance of lifestyle factors for overweight and obesity in adults: pooled evidence from CHNS and NHANES,"Background
Overweight and obesity pose a huge burden on individuals and society. While the relationship between lifestyle factors and overweight and obesity is well-established, the relative contribution of specific lifestyle factors remains unclear. To address this gap in the literature, this study utilizes interpretable machine learning methods to identify the relative importance of specific lifestyle factors as predictors of overweight and obesity in adults.

Methods
Data were obtained from 46,057 adults in the China Health and Nutrition Survey (2004–2011) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2007–2014). Basic demographic information, self-reported lifestyle factors, including physical activity, macronutrient intake, tobacco and alcohol consumption, and body weight status were collected. Three machine learning models, namely decision tree, random forest, and gradient-boosting decision tree, were employed to predict body weight status from lifestyle factors. The SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method was used to interpret the prediction results of the best-performing model by determining the contributions of specific lifestyle factors to the development of overweight and obesity in adults.

Results
The performance of the gradient-boosting decision tree model outperformed the decision tree and random forest models. Analysis based on the SHAP method indicates that sedentary behavior, alcohol consumption, and protein intake were important lifestyle factors predicting the development of overweight and obesity in adults. The amount of alcohol consumption and time spent sedentary were the strongest predictors of overweight and obesity, respectively. Specifically, sedentary behavior exceeding 28–35 h/week, alcohol consumption of more than 7 cups/week, and protein intake exceeding 80 g/day increased the risk of being predicted as overweight and obese.

Conclusion
Pooled evidence from two nationally representative studies suggests that recognizing demographic differences and emphasizing the relative importance of sedentary behavior, alcohol consumption, and protein intake are beneficial for managing body weight status in adults. The specific risk thresholds for lifestyle factors observed in this study can help inform and guide future research and public health actions.","Given that different lifestyle factors may not be equally important for the development of overweight and obesity in adults, this study used interpretable machine learning methods to identify the relative importance of specific lifestyle factors for being predicted as overweight and obese adults. Pooled data from two large-scale population-based studies, encompassing over 40,000 adults, indicated that time spent sedentary, amount of alcohol consumption and smoking, and protein intake were important lifestyle factors that are associated with overweight and obesity in adults. Notably, higher levels of alcohol consumption and sedentary behavior were the strongest predictors of being classified as overweight and obese, respectively. These findings align with previous studies that emphasize sedentary behavior and alcohol consumption as critical targets for obesity prevention and intervention [16, 24].

Regarding demographic factors, our study provides evidence that country, race/ethnicity, and age are important determinants of overweight and obesity in adults. Firstly, living in a high-income country typically fosters a specific — also referred to as “Western” lifestyle (e.g., the ability to purchase high-calorie foods and high time spent in sedentary behaviors) that contributes to a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity [59]. In low- and middle-income countries, affected by processes such as globalization and urbanization, traditional eating habits are increasingly being replaced by Western high-calorie diets [60]. Secondly, recent studies suggest that genetic differences among racial/ethnic groups may influence metabolic rate, energy expenditure, and fat storage, which in turn is reflected in the prevalence rates of overweight and obesity [61]. Moreover, racial/ethnic groups often differ in terms of socioeconomic status and public resource allocation. For instance, lower socioeconomic status is often associated with a higher prevalence of obesity, as it may limit access to healthy foods and opportunities for physical activity [62]. Thirdly, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in adults increases with age [63], though it may decrease in older adults due to health issues (e.g., malnutrition) [64]. Specifically, the prevalence of obesity is highest among middle-aged adults, which may be related to work pressure, which may result in a lack of physical activity, and irregular eating habits [65]. Taken together, the findings of this study support the notion that a strong association exists between demographic factors and overweight and obesity status. Future research should consider other demographic factors (e.g., socioeconomic status [62]) to advance our understanding of the relationship between lifestyle factors and overweight and obesity in adults.

More importantly, our findings indicate that time spent sedentary, amount of alcohol consumption and smoking, and protein intake are important lifestyle factors associated with overweight and obesity in adults. To begin with, this observation aligns with findings from a systematic review that reported a relationship between higher levels of sedentary behavior and weight gain in adults [66]. Prolonged periods of sedentary behavior reduce daily energy expenditure. When energy expenditure is lower than energy intake, unconsumed energy is stored as fat, contributing to the development of overweight and obesity [44]. Sedentary behavior may also decrease the activity of lipoprotein lipase, which can negatively affect fat metabolism and utilization, thereby exacerbating fat accumulation and weight gain [67]. Besides, there is substantial evidence that alcohol consumption is associated with overweight and obesity [68], which is consistent with our findings. Alcohol is inherently high in energy, and its consumption increases total energy intake, particularly when paired with high-energy foods, potentially leading to an energy surplus and subsequent weight gain [69]. Alcohol consumption also influences neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation, which can lead to increased consumption of energy-dense foods [70]. In contrast to alcohol consumption, our study found that tobacco consumption is negatively associated with overweight and obesity. Evidence suggests that smoking may reduce body weight by elevating the resting metabolic rate while diminishing the expected increase in food intake associated with this metabolic increase [71]. However, since smoking is a significant risk factor for adverse health outcomes [72], using smoking as a weight management strategy is not recommended for adults. Finally, we observed that excessive protein intake is associated with overweight and obesity in adults. It is important to note that the evidence regarding the relationship between protein intake and overweight and obesity in adults is mixed. Previous studies have indicated that a high-protein diet increases energy expenditure and satiety, which can aid in weight loss [73, 74]. However, other studies observed that protein intake is positively correlated with overweight and obesity [75, 76]. For example, a cross-sectional study that examined the relationship between macronutrient intake and adiposity in adults found a positive correlation between protein intake and BMI, body fat percentage, sagittal abdominal diameter, and waist circumference in men [75]. Another survey of the Chinese adults population also emphasized that higher protein and fat intake are associated with an increased risk of being overweight and obese [76]. These mixed findings may partly result from the effects of different protein sources (animal versus plant protein) on overweight and obesity [77]. Thus, further studies are needed to clarify the underlying biological mechanisms that may explain this phenomenon.

Additionally, three machine learning models, namely DT, RF, and GBDT, were established to predict the body weight status in adults. The precision and AUC of the GBDT (best-performing) model were 65.2% and 58.3% in the overweight test set, and 78.5% and 73.6% in the obesity test set. Lin et al. developed nine machine learning models to identify relevant risk factors for overweight [78]. The results suggest that the CatBoost model achieved a precision of 81% in the test set, outperforming other models, such as RF, SVM, and LR. This model also outperformed the GBDT model used in our study. The potential reason may be that the association between different variables is an important factor determining the performance of the machine learning models. On the one hand, compared with the waist and hip circumference factors included in the CatBoost model, lifestyle factors may be relatively minor contributors to predicting overweight in adults. On the other hand, Cheng et al. used multiple machine-learning methods to predict adult obesity from physical activity levels [79]. The random subspace and classification via regression models achieved the highest AUC of 64.3%. The performance of these two models in predicting obesity was lower than that of the best-performing model in our study. This is not surprising, as our study included a more comprehensive set of lifestyle factors, with physical activity or its absence (i.e., time spent sedentary) considered as only single factors in our analysis. This also indicates that including more relevant factors in the models can improve their performance. In addition, future research can refer to the SAFE framework [80] to comprehensively measure the application of artificial intelligence from the perspectives of sustainability, accuracy, fairness, and explainability.

Finally, our study provides thresholds for how exposure to specific lifestyle factors is associated with overweight and obesity in adults. Specifically, spending more than 28–35 h/week in sedentary behaviors, consuming more than 7 cups of alcohol/week, and consuming more than 80 g of protein/day were observed to increase the risk of being predicted as overweight and obese adults. In addition, insufficient occupational and recreational physical activity, higher carbohydrate intake, and any level of alcohol consumption also increased the risk of being predicted as overweight or obese. In this context, the WHO has emphasized the importance of a healthy lifestyle for body weight management, which includes limiting screen time and engaging in regular physical activity [6]. The weight management strategies recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Adults include engaging in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for 2.5–5 h/week, limiting sedentary activity to less than 2–4 h/day, consuming no more than 70 g of livestock and poultry meat/day, and strictly limiting alcohol consumption [81]. The obesity strategies proposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention include following the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, engaging in moderate-intensity physical activity for at least 2.5 h/week, sleeping for 7–9 h/day, and managing stress effectively [82]. Compared with these guidelines, our findings are more liberal. In particular, our findings suggest (i) that time spent in sedentary behavior should be limited to 28–35 h/week, which is higher than the guidelines, and (ii) that alcohol consumption should be limited to no more than 7 cups/week, rather than being completely restricted. These findings suggest that also less restrictive lifestyle guideline criteria are perhaps effective in preventing overweight and obesity, although future studies in this direction are required to draw more robust conclusions. In addition, the risk thresholds for various types of physical activity (e.g., recreational) and specific macronutrient intakes (e.g., protein) were quantified in our study. These unique contributions of our work may offer valuable information for updating and refining body weight management strategies in adults.

The following limitations need to be considered when interpreting the findings of our study. Firstly, predicting body weight status from lifestyle factors can be challenging because of the myriad of factors influencing overweight and obesity that were not assessed by the surveys or included in our models (e.g., sleep duration is associated with body weight status [83], but was not assessed in CHNS). In addition, given that the definition of the confounding variables (e.g., socioeconomic status) differ between the two databases, it was difficult to specifically control for the effects of these factors. Secondly, using more sophisticated models (e.g., complex neural network models) may help improve prediction performance but at the expense of interpretability. Thirdly, this study only included adults from China and the US. Future research should include data from other populations to assess the generalizability of our findings to different cultural contexts."

To screen for predictive obesity factors in overweight populations using an optimal and interpretable machine learning algorithm.

Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted between June 2011 and January 2012. The participants were randomly selected using a simple random sampling technique. Seven commonly used machine learning methods were employed to construct obesity risk prediction models. A total of 5,236 Chinese participants from Ningde City, Fujian Province, Southeast China, participated in this study. The best model was selected through appropriate verification and validation and suitably explained. Subsequently, a minimal set of significant predictors was identified. The Shapley additive explanation force plot was used to illustrate the model at the individual level.

Results
Machine learning models for predicting obesity have demonstrated strong performance, with CatBoost emerging as the most effective in both model validity and net clinical benefit. Specifically, the CatBoost algorithm yielded the highest scores, registering 0.91 in the training set and an impressive 0.83 in the test set. This was further corroborated by the area under the curve (AUC) metrics, where CatBoost achieved 0.95 for the training set and 0.87 for the test set. In a rigorous five-fold cross-validation, the AUC for the CatBoost model ranged between 0.84 and 0.91, with an average AUC of ROC at 0.87 ± 0.022. Key predictors identified within these models included waist circumference, hip circumference, female gender, and systolic blood pressure.

Conclusion
CatBoost may be the best machine learning method for prediction. Combining Shapley’s additive explanation and machine learning methods can be effective in identifying disease risk factors for prevention and control.","This study aimed to identify a minimal set of important but most common factors for obesity prediction using the selected optimal machine learning algorithm among 5,236 adults with overweight. The study identified four important factors which can better differentiate overweight subgroups who have a propensity to have obesity from the general overweight population. Moreover, CatBoost is superior to the other six machine learning programs and ranks as the best algorithm. Finally, the application of SHAP (24) in machine learning models solved the problem of poor readability and could better interpret the model established by machine learning and apply it to the early detection, monitoring, and intervention of obesity.

CatBoost is a novel machine learning algorithm with two innovations: Ordered Target Statistics and Ordered Boosting (25). Recently, studies have verified that CatBoost has the best prediction results among all algorithms for all metrics except for specificity for data from various datasets, including those for biochemistry, medicine, and others (25). Traditional biostatistical methods to assess models mainly focus on prediction models for specificity, sensitivity, and AUC. These approaches are mathematically simple to perform but have low clinical relevance. DCA was developed to overcome the limitations of traditional biostatistical approaches and can help assess whether using a model to aid clinical decision-making would improve patient outcomes (26). Thus, DCA was applied to help analyze whether the various models could improve predictive outcomes for patients in this study, especially for the CatBoost model.

In principle, artificial intelligence methods based on machine learning, such as CatBoost, bend to black box models. Compared with traditional models, these black box models exhibit significant advantages in acquiring accurate predictions (27). However, the machine learning models currently in use are not explainable (27). Thus, the SHAP model was developed. In the SHAP model, the SHAP value is a uniform measure of the importance of the features used in machine learning models (16, 28, 29). By attributing output values to the SHAP value of each feature, researchers have performed interpretable analyses of machine learning models (30). Furthermore, the SHAP force plot illustrates the prediction model at an individual level. Through the SHAP analysis of individual samples, we can screen high-risk samples and identify high-risk patients. The results of the interpretability analysis demonstrated the excellent applicability and generalizability of the findings obtained using the CatBoost model.

Based on the CatBoost algorithm, four features were screened, including WC, HC, female sex, and SBP. WC and HC contributed the most to the model. Taking full account of both WC and HC separately, rather than as a ratio measure, has been suggested as a stronger risk predictor of premature death in individuals who are overweight and obese (31). Cameron et al. (32) and Seidell et al. (31) demonstrates that the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is a weak predictor of the specific influences of each measurement, as individuals with an identical WHR can have different waist and hip circumferences.

The correlation between WC and all-cause mortality remains a hot controversial topic. As BMI does not reflect the distribution of fat, WC provided further information about the risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, which increases with increasing BMI and WC (33). A prospective observational study conducted by Frank B. Hu suggested a potential causal association between higher WC and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (34). In accordance with Frank B. Hu, Cerhan et al. also showed that a higher WC is positively associated with higher mortality (35). Hence, they suggested that WC should be evaluated in combination with BMI, even for those in the normal and overweight BMI range in adults, as part of the risk evaluation for obesity-related premature mortality (34, 35).

Moreover, there is increasing evidence that changes in WC might be associated with obesity and additional health outcomes compared to static weight status (34, 35). Cabrera et al. showed that WC was a better indicator of fat mass in older individuals than BMI (36). Aging is usually associated with a higher WC, and redistribution of fat to the abdominal region is often reported in older individuals (37). Therefore, it is important to evaluate long-term trends in WC among adults with overweight.

Waist and hip circumferences measure different aspects of body composition and fat distribution, and have independent effects on CVD factors (32). Cameron et al. showed a strong confounding effect of HC on the correlation between obesity and both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (32). Moreover, some studies support the powerful association between HC and either heart disease or metabolic disorders, which only becomes apparent after adjustment for WC (38). Narrow hips may reflect less subcutaneous fat, which could have a beneficial influence on the risk factors. However, according to the SHAP plot value in this study, a higher HC reflected a higher risk of obesity among individuals with overweight. There are two potential explanations for this observation. First, narrow hip circumferences may alternatively reflect gluteal atrophy. Second, the average age of the participants included in this study was 55 years, which implied that most participants were middle-aged. Up to 30% of community-dwelling participants older than 50 years live with sarcopenia, an age-related decline in muscle mass (39). Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) show that 33.5% of females and 12.6% of males over 60 years of age were sarcopenic obese (40). With aging, not only does body fat increase, but it is also distributed differently.

Sex and SBP also were contributors. Our results show that the female sex is a predictive factor for obesity among individuals with overweight. Fat mass, fat distribution, and muscle mass differed between females and males. Males commonly have lower fat mass than females, but have higher insulin resistance due to the abundant fat distributed in the abdominal region (41). Conversely, females commonly have lower body mass-adjusted muscle mass than males (41) and females with type 2 diabetes are at heightened risk for obesity (42). Additionally, SBP is another predictor. Overweight manifests early as autonomic dysregulation (43). Taffe et al. found that an increase in SBP is positively associated with an increase in BMI (44). This is in line with the expectation that SBP, a measure of blood force during ventricular contraction, is influenced more by sympathetic cardiac activity (44). Furthermore, some studies have suggested that the basic cause of high SBP in overweight participants is mainly due to a combination of factors that promote atherosclerosis and systemic vascular resistance (45).

This study has a few limitations. First, this was a single-center, cross-sectional investigation. Future multicenter longitudinal cohort studies should be conducted to verify the accuracy of the model. Second, this study aimed to identify the most common and easily acquired features for predicting obesity. Thus, although diet habits, physical activity, and economic status may be affected, they have not yet been analyzed because of the variety and complexity of these data."
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10916-008-9165-5,The Classification of Obesity Disease in Logistic Regression and Neural Network Methods,"The aim of this study is to establish an automated system to recognize and to follow-up obesity. In this study, the areas affected from obesity were examined with a classification considering the divergent arteries and body mass index of 30 healthy and 52 obese people by using two different mathematical models such as the traditional statistical method based on logistic regression and a multi-layer perception (MLP) neural network, and then classifying performances of logistic regression and neural network were compared. As a result of this comparison, it is observed that the classifying performance of neural network is better than logistic regression; also the reasons of this result were examined. Furthermore, after these classifications it is observed that in obesity the body mass index is more affected than the divergent arteries.","These results show the application of obesity data to neural network may produce a new and reliable classification system for rapidly diagnosing. Thus, it can be seen clearly that the performance of the neural network model is better than the logistic regression model. At the same time when considering the parameters inside the data set, obesity has also affected the body mass index more than arteries.

Obesity has increased especially for the last two decades all over the world and spreads like an epidemic disease. This automated system of artificial intelligence may be useful tool to evaluate human subjects in particular in places where huge counts of applicants are needed to be examined, such as military organizations or industrial corporations. As a time-saving and cost-effective system, it may also be used for screening of populations in public health."
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11439005/,Visualization obesity risk prediction system based on machine learning,"Obesity is closely associated with various chronic diseases.Therefore, accurate, reliable and cost-effective methods for preventing its occurrence and progression are required. In this study, we developed a visualized obesity risk prediction system based on machine learning techniques, aiming to achieve personalized comprehensive health management for obesity. The system utilized a dataset consisting of 1678 anonymized health examination records, including individual lifestyle factors, body composition, blood routine, and biochemical tests. Ten multi-classification machine learning models, including Random Forest and XGBoost, were constructed to identify non-obese individuals (BMI < 25), class 1 obese individuals (25 ≤ BMI < 30), and class 2 obese individuals (30 ≤ BMI). By evaluating the performance of each model on the test set, we selected XGBoost as the best model and built the visualized obesity risk prediction system based on it. The system exhibited good predictive performance and interpretability, directly providing users with their obesity risk levels and determining corresponding intervention priorities. In conclusion, the developed obesity risk prediction system possesses high accuracy and interactivity, aiding physicians in formulating personalized health management plans and achieving comprehensive and accurate obesity management.","Accurate and interpretable risk assessment is crucial for obesity prevention and intervention21,22. The proposed obesity prediction system in this study is an important health management tool that can assist physicians in deciding whether to intervene and develop personalized intervention plans.

We first assessed the performance of ten machine learning models in obesity prediction based on health examination data and established an obesity risk assessment model with good predictive performance. In contrast to similar studies23–26, we did not simply classify the population into obese and non-obese groups, we further divided the obese population into class 1 and class 2 obesity. Additionally, the predictive accuracy of our trained machine learning models on the test set was higher than that in similar studies. This maybe due to the fact that our best model was selected from a larger pool of machine learning models, and we employed a Monte Carlo Cross-Validation algorithm during the training process. The ten machine learning models we used included tree models, deep learning models, and traditional statistical models, and the tree model XGB demonstrated the best predictive performance. This may be because traditional statistical models like LR are more suitable for linear or normally distributed problems, while deep learning models are better suited for image or natural language processing tasks and have poorer predictive performance on small-sample tabular data27.

On the basis of the XGB model, we constructed a visual obesity risk prediction system using the SHAP algorithm, making the output results of the machine learning model interpretable. In this study, in addition to incorporating features such as age, gender, lifestyle, and blood routine, we also included body composition data such as total body water, protein content, and basal metabolic rate as variables. According to the SHAP interpretation results (Fig. 5C), bone mineral content was important predictors of class 2 obesity. This is consistent with the findings of Hwaung et al., which indicate that obesity is not only characterized by excessive adipose tissue but also by changes in characteristics such as protein content in skin and visceral organs28. Among the variables related to blood biochemistry, elevated triglycerides levels increased the risk of class 1 obesity, while elevated glycated hemoglobin and uric acid levels increased the risk of class 2 obesity. Conversely, decreased triglyceride and glycated hemoglobin A1 levels increased the probability of non-obesity (Fig. 5). These findings are in line with the research by Jeon et al., which identified triglycerides, glycated hemoglobin, and uric acid as important features for assessing obesity risk24. Indicators such as triglycerides and glycated hemoglobin are important features for assessing obesity risk, this may be because there is a close relationship between high triglyceride levels and insulin resistance, insulin resistance can lead to fluctuations in blood sugar levels, further stimulating excessive secretion of insulin, elevated insulin levels can promote fat synthesis and storage29,30. Therefore, when predicting obesity risk, it is necessary to consider not only common features such as lifestyle but also body composition and blood biochemical indicators in order to provide early intervention for individuals at high risk of obesity.

In this study, we constructed an obesity risk prediction system based on the XGB model and SHAP technology, which is accessible on a webpage. To explain the usage of this system, we presented an example of its use in Fig. 6. After inputting information into the left-hand input interface, the system indicates that the BMI of the examined individual does not currently reach the obesity level, but the risk probability of class 1 obesity is 34.77%. In the SHAP plot below, the length of the feature bar indicates the strength of its influence on the risk probability, where red represents positive influence and blue represents negative influence. Factors contributing positively to the risk of class 1 obesity include hip circumference, alcohol consumption, and glycated hemoglobin A1, while factors contributing negatively include triglycerides, lymphocyte percentage, red blood cell distribution width, and diet. Therefore, targeted control of factors such as hip circumference, alcohol consumption, and glycated hemoglobin A1 can reduce the risk of class 1 obesity. Our constructed obesity risk prediction system allows information input through individual entries and file reading, providing personalized obesity risk assessment for examination personnel in a more convenient and user-friendly manner, laying the foundation for the practical application of future prediction systems.

We are aware that our study has some limitations. Although we randomly divided the dataset into a training set and a test set, the results may still be influenced by the source of the data due to its single source. Additionally, the class 2 obese population was relatively less in the dataset, although we applied the SMOTE algorithm for over-sampling during model training, the F1-score for class 2 obesity by the best model was still lower than the other two classes, indicating relatively lower predictive ability for class 2 obesity. Lastly, the obesity risk prediction system developed in this study was based on the XGB model. While the XGB model demonstrated the best overall performance, its recall rate for the non-obese class was lower than that of the LGB and BPNN models, suggesting a potential need to improve the model’s predictive performance for the non-obese class through optimization algorithms or other approaches."
